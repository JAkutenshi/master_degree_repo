## Roadmap

### Stage 1 - Create docker images with equal environment -  DONE (except OpenRTM)
- [x] Make dockerfile for ROS.
- [x] Make dockerfile for MIRA.
- [x] Make dockerfile for OROCOS.
- [x] Make dockerfile for YARP.
- [ ] Make dockerfile for OpenRTM-aist. (waiting for docs, later)

### Stage 2 - Analyse middlewares documentation and sorts by categories their exists communication methods
- [ ] Make communication_methods.md for ROS.
- [ ] Make communication_methods.md for MIRA.
- [ ] Make communication_methods.md for OROCOS.
- [ ] Make communication_methods.md for YARP.
- [ ] Make communication_methods.md for OpenRTM-aist.

### Stage 3 - Make benchmark docker images with tests for all methods from Stage 2
- [ ] Make benchmark dockerfile for ROS.
- [ ] Make benchmark dockerfile for MIRA.
- [ ] Make benchmark dockerfile for OROCOS.
- [ ] Make benchmark dockerfile for YARP.
- [ ] Make benchmark dockerfile for OpenRTM-aist.

### Stage 4 - Make statistics analyse of performans testing results
- [ ] Make statistics result (md/latex + R code) for ROS.
- [ ] Make statistics result (md/latex + R code) for MIRA.
- [ ] Make statistics result (md/latex + R code) for OROCOS.
- [ ] Make statistics result (md/latex + R code) for YARP.
- [ ] Make statistics result (md/latex + R code) for OpenRTM-aist.

### Stage 5 - Assuming all previous tech solutions in one project
- [ ] Use Case diagram
- [ ] DFD Diagram
- [ ] Class Diagram
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Backend

### Stage 5.5 - Add some features (only if all previous stages complete before May 12th)
- [ ] Exporting diagrams and RMarkdown files

### Stage 6 - Write commercialization chapter
- [ ] LaTeX chapter was written.

### Stage 7
- [ ] Brings LaTeX template to terms of SPbETU's template. (Verify it!)
- [ ] Make prospect-plan.
- [ ] Complete dissertation with existing information from paper.

## Deadlines


## The repository's structure

- dissertation/ - directory for my Master's degree order. Works with LaTeX.

- dockerfiles/  - directory for created docker images for highlited frameworks.

- examples/ - direcotory for examples of some code (e.g. Hayai usage).

- paper/ - directory for my previously wrote research (don't laught, it's painful...) paper.

(WIP)
