\chapter*{Abstract}
In this work highlights such subject as application software development for autonomous robots. During the domain survey four variants of multiagent robotics middleware were selected for detailed consideration of the communication principles within the multi-agent system. Was created performance test plan, were researched a number of factors which can potentially impact to multiagent robotics application throw the communication layer of middleware. Also was developed testing environment, benchmark testing library, test cases implementation and tests results analyser for three middleware frameworks of the four selected ones. During the analysis of the results, a number of hypotheses were disproved, as well as a number of statements about the performance of the solutions tested.
